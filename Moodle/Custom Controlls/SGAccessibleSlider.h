/**
 
 ## Overview
 
 A visual control used to select a single value from a continuous range of values.
 As you move the thumb of a slider, it passes its updated value to any actions attached to it.
 
 ## Features
 
 - All settings are inspectable in the Interface Builder
 
 - Easy accessibility support
 
 ## Discussion
 
 The main advantage of the SGAccessibleSlider is its accessibility behavior.
 Instead of the default percentage value it will return the actual value that is currently set suffixed with the specified unit.
 
 All other behaviour is inherited from the UISlider class.
