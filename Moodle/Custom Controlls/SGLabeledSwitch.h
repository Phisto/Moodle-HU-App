/**
 
 ## Overview
 
 You can use the SGLabeledSwitch class to create and manage the On/Off buttons used, for example,
 in the Settings app for options such as Airplane Mode and Bluetooth. 
 Compared to the regular UISwitch, it displays a label for a decription text.
 
 ## Features
 
 - Most settings are inspectable and designable in the Interface Builder
 
 - Easy accessibility support
 
 ## Discussion
 
 The main advantage of the SGLabeledSwitch is its accessibility behavior.
 With VoiceOver enabled the whole control (switch and label) will funktion as a switch.
 No need to configure accessibility label, traits or hint.
